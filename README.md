## Problem Statement

Obesity is a global health epidemic that has significant implications for public health. This project aims to develop a multi-class classification system to predict obesity levels in individuals based on their eating habits and physical condition. 

The goal is to classify individuals into one of seven obesity categories:
1. Insufficient Weight
2. Normal Weight
3. Overweight Level I
4. Overweight Level II
5. Obesity Type I
6. Obesity Type II
7. Obesity Type III

By implementing and comparing multiple machine learning classification models, this project identifies the most effective approach for obesity level prediction, which can assist healthcare professionals in early intervention and personalized health recommendations.

## Model Observations

| ML Model Name | Observation about model performance |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Logistic Regression** | Provides a solid baseline with approximately 86% accuracy. The model shows good AUC (0.97+), indicating effective class probability estimation. Performance is limited by the linear decision boundary assumption, which may not capture complex non-linear relationships between eating habits and obesity levels. The model is highly interpretable and fast to train, making it suitable for understanding feature importance through coefficients. |
| **Decision Tree** | Achieves strong performance (~91% accuracy) with the ability to capture non-linear patterns and feature interactions. The model is prone to overfitting without depth constraints (max_depth=10 used). Provides excellent interpretability through feature importance scores and tree visualization. Particularly effective at identifying threshold-based rules (e.g., weight > X and physical activity < Y implies obesity). |
| **KNN** | Demonstrates moderate performance (~87% accuracy) that is highly dependent on feature scaling and the choice of k (k=5 used). Works well when similar obesity levels form clusters in the feature space. The model is computationally expensive during prediction for large datasets. Performance could improve with optimal k selection through cross-validation and feature selection to reduce dimensionality. |
| **Naive Bayes** | Shows the lowest performance among all models (~82% accuracy) due to the strong assumption of feature independence, which is violated in this dataset (e.g., height and weight are correlated, as are eating habits features). Despite limitations, provides the fastest training and prediction times. The model's simplicity makes it useful as a baseline and for quick prototyping. Higher AUC (~0.97) suggests reasonable probability calibration despite lower accuracy. |
| **Random Forest (Ensemble)** | Delivers excellent performance (~95.5% accuracy) through ensemble averaging that significantly reduces overfitting compared to single decision trees. The model is robust to outliers and handles the mixed feature types (numerical and categorical) effectively. Feature importance analysis reveals weight, height, and physical activity frequency (FAF) as the most predictive features. The 100-tree ensemble provides a good balance between performance and computational efficiency. |
| **XGBoost (Ensemble)** | Achieves the best overall performance with ~97% accuracy and 0.998 AUC, making it the top-performing model for this obesity classification task. Sequential gradient boosting effectively captures complex feature interactions and non-linear relationships. Built-in L1/L2 regularization prevents overfitting despite the model's complexity. The learning rate of 0.1 with 100 estimators provides optimal convergence. Recommended as the production model for deployment due to superior generalization and robust performance across all metrics. |
